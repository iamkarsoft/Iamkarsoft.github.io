 My web development skills extend to frontend aspects of web development including JavaScript and Vue, 
 LESS/Sass/CSS, as well as designing databases and building applications that can scale.

I am a self-starter, a leader, and most importantly a team player. I've had the pleasure of working for a start-up from infancy to launch and now serving over 1,000 users and counting. Throughout that journey, I went from being an intern to a full-time Software Engineer and finally to leading a team of 3 Software Engineers. During my time at Cashaam, I successfully built, maintained, and upgraded 3 different e-commerce web applications helping small businesses both in the United States and in Nigeria.

Specialties:
• Ability to quickly learn new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, responsive design principles, and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code.
• JavaScript, React, Next Js, Node.js, Express.js, HTML5, CSS3, PostgreSQL, Firebase, Python, Django, jQuery, AJAX, Bootstrap and Git/GitHub.
