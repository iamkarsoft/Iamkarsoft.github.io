### Project management lifecycle


- Initiating

- Planning

- Executing

- Monitoring

- Closing

<br>
### Project Characteristics

1- Specific Scope

2- Precise Timeline ( start / end date)

3- Resources (people / items)

<br>

### The triple constraint

<p>Projects have constraints. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that the project is delivered within the constraints.</p>

<p>These constraints specify that:</p>




- Projects must be delivered within budget (cost).

- Projects must be delivered before the deadline (time).

- Projects should contain all the features required (scope).

- Projects should function as expected (i.e. be of the required quality).

- These constraints can be expressed as a triangle (where cost, scope and time are vertices and quality is in the middle).


### Initiating

Should we be doing this project? the goal is to obtain approval
 <br>

### Planning phase

the planning phase is where you create tasks, timeline; you find how much the project will cost and the people going to work on the project.
 <br>
### Execution 

This where the plan is executed, this where most of the work is done following the plan drawn in the  planning phase.
 <br>

### Monitoring phase

This phase is done simultaneously with the execution phase. Here you monitor the quality and the tasks.
 <br>

### Closing

Formal acceptance and deliverables.
