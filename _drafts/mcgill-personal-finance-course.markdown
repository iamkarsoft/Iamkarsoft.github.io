### Common Sources of Debt

People borrow money because of instant gratification.

**Credit Card**  

- Annual interest rate(15% -20%)
- annual fees
- paying minimum monthly balance (21 days)
  


**Line of Card** 
  
- Loan from a bank
- Overdraft
- start interest immediately
- personal, student , secured, unsecured are the different types
- interest and fees are lower than credit card
- behaviour and habits sometimes accumulate higher balance making it hard to pay.
  


**Long term financing**
  
- Needs collateral


**Mortgages**
  
- specific to real estate
- minimum down payment is(20% to 50%)
- if lower thatn 20%, you will need to purchase mortgage insurances
- Mortgages = (Property value - downpayment) + additional fees
- Changing contract means additional fees
    + Amortization period(time to pay loan)
    + decide type of interest rate
    + frequency of mortgage payment




### Credit Scores

Creditors access your behavior using your **credit report**. Information stays on your credit report for **6 years**.  

**Calculation of credit score**  
  
it ranges from 300 to 900. Having good credit will help you have better interest rates. 
  
### Rules of Borrowing

- always insure you're using debt wisely
- make sure you need something before you buy something
- have a sound financial plan  
  
## Your Money: Today and Tomorrow
  
Discover the importance of the time value of money and learn concepts such as compounding and discounting and the role they play in managing and growing your money. 
  
### Compounding

- present value vrs future value.
- future value are larger  FV = PV x {1+ r}t . r = interest rate per period in decimal i.e 4% is 0.04, t = time
- You can only compare money at the same point of time (today and 2 years ago).
- This is making money travel forward 
- receiving money today is much more valuable than receiving money in the future because
    + you can't compare money in both times
    + due to the potential investment of money received today

### Discounting
   
- This is making money travel backwards
- PV = FV / {1 +r}t
- discounting is the reverse of compounding
  
### Everyday Applications
  

- save bi-weekly will give interest more than saving at the end of month.
- pay bi-weekly will reduce the interest than paying a lumbsome at the end of the month.
