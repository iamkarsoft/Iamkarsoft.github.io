## Understanding Debt and Borrowing 
  

### Common Sources of Debt

People borrow money because of instant gratification.



- the credit limit
- the cost of borrowing
- when it need to be repaid
- how often is it to be repaid

**Credit Card**  

- Annual interest rate(15% -20%)
- annual fees
- paying minimum monthly balance (21 days)
  


**Line of Card** 
  
- Loan from a bank
- Overdraft
- start interest immediately
- personal, student , secured, unsecured are the different types
- interest and fees are lower than credit card
- behaviour and habits sometimes accumulate higher balance making it hard to pay.
  


**Long term financing**
  
- Needs collateral


**Mortgages**
  
- specific to real estate
- minimum down payment is(20% to 50%)
- if lower thatn 20%, you will need to purchase mortgage insurances
- Mortgages = (Property value - downpayment) + additional fees
- Changing contract means additional fees
    + Amortization period(time to pay loan)
    + decide type of interest rate
    + frequency of mortgage payment




### Credit Scores

Creditors access your behavior using your **credit report**. Information stays on your credit report for **6 years**.  

**Calculation of credit score**  
  
it ranges from 300 to 900. Having good credit will help you have better interest rates. 
  
### Rules of Borrowing
  
- Try to live within your means
- always insure you're using debt wisely
- make sure you need something before you buy something
- have a sound financial plan  
  
## Your Money: Today and Tomorrow
  
Discover the importance of the time value of money and learn concepts such as compounding and discounting and the role they play in managing and growing your money. 
  
### Compounding

- present value vrs future value.
- future value are larger  FV = PV x {1+ r}t . r = interest rate per period in decimal i.e 4% is 0.04, t = time
- You can only compare money at the same point of time (today and 2 years ago).
- This is making money travel forward 
- receiving money today is much more valuable than receiving money in the future because
    + you can't compare money in both times
    + due to the potential investment of money received today

### Discounting
   
- This is making money travel backwards
- PV = FV / {1 +r}t
- discounting is the reverse of compounding
  
### Everyday Applications
  

- save bi-weekly will give interest more than saving at the end of month.
- pay bi-weekly will reduce the interest than paying a lumbsome at the end of the month.

## The Art of Investing part 1
  

### Investment Options  
 
**Stocks**  

 - Stocks are very risky
 - Buying stocks means you own part of the company.When you buy a stock, you own part of the company. This means that you make money if the company does well, but if the company does poorly, you lose money. As such, there are no guarantees that you will earn investment income by buying stocks.
 - You may either gain or lose money depending on how well the company is doing
   
**Bonds**
  
- Bonds are IOUs
- when you buy bonds, you loan money to companies and the companies pay back with interest.
- Great thing about bonds is you make profit if the company still alive
- They are less risky than stocks
- Stocks offer higher returns to investors
- Bond returns depends on interest rates.
- A Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) is an example of a short-term bond issued by banks. They are very safe investments because they guarantee your original investment as well as a specific rate of return.

    + buy different kind of stocks
    + buy index funds 
    + invest in international markets as well

### Government Incentives
  
- TFSA  is a government registered account which is investment task free account
    + If you go over your TFSA contribution limit, you will incur a monthly penalty as long as the excess remains in your account
    + An investment advisor can identify strategies that can reduce the amount of tax you pay today and in retirement, based on your personal tax and income situation.
    + If you go over your TFSA contribution limit, you will incur a monthly penalty as long as the excess remains in your account


- Registered retired savings plan
    + allows to contribute eligle salary
    + it's tax excempt unless you do a withdrawal 
    + tax are calculated based on marginal tax rate of the year of withdrawal
    + using an rrsp will provide more high effective after tax returns
- Both RRSPs and TFSAs are registered accounts with the Canadian government that have been established to help Canadians save, and they come with significant tax advantages. While RRSPs are specifically designed for retirement savings, TFSAs are flexible retirement vehicles that can be used for retirement or other personal goals.
- When you pay down debt, you have a guaranteed rate of return equal to the rate of interest you’re avoiding. For example, if you’re paying $100 toward your credit card balance, which carries an interest rate of 19.99%, you “save” having to pay interest of 19.99%.  Another way you can look at it is that you’re “earning” a 19.99% rate of return on your investment. What’s more, interest saved on paying down debt is not taxed, making the case for paying down debt even stronger.
