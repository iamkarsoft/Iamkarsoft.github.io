## Shaping

There are a few steps in shaping

- <em>Setting boundaries</em> this is where we figure how much time we want to spend on the project
- <em>Rough out the elements</em> we make a rough sketch of our solutions and what we want to build
- <em> Addressing risks and rabbit holes</em> this is where find holes and unanswered questions that could trip us up
- <em>write the pitch</em> we write a pitch that contains the problem, constraints, solution, rabbit holes, and limitations.


## Set Boundaries


### The appetite

the appetite is where we start building in chunks the solution and are done in batches (2 weeks to 6 weeks).
<br>
- Small batch (2 weeks and more later)
- Big Batch ( 6 weeks)


### Fixed time, Varaiable scope

 An estimate starts with design and end with a number, in contrast an appetite starts with a number and ends with a design.

#### Good is relative

 the best is relative to your constraints. One shouldn't make a commitment that they don't understand until they have shaped the project enough to bet resources on. 


### Narrow down the problem

Instead of asking`what's could we build`, ask `what's really going wrong?`.

<br>
In conclusion , Having a boundaries in place is having 3 key things. `A raw idea`, `an appetite` and a `narrow problem definition`.
