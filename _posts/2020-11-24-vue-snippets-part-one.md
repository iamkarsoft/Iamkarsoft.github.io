A few things i want to remember about vuejs


### The big parts

These are the things i have to learn


 - [ ] &nbsp; Control Flow
 - [ ] &nbsp; Components
 - [ ] &nbsp; Data Binding
 - [ ] &nbsp; Routing
 - [ ] &nbsp;  State Management


```
el: "#app" //for instantiating vue
data:{}  // where you declare / define your data
methods:{} // where you write your functions
computed:{}

```



 - `v-show` `v-if` `v-else` `v-else-if`  for conditional flow
 - `v-for` for looping
 - `v-bind` for binding elements 
 - `:class` or `:style` for binding css classes and styling
